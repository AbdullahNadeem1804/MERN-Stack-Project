We have two things, one is client and one is server. 
I used VS Code.
Firstly go to your project fresh folder and open terminal in the folder. 
Run "npm init vite" and create the client folder. Then go into the client folder and run "npm install"
Then run "npm install axios react-router-dom
And now run "npm run dev"
The client is now up and running, you can now paste the files i have provided in the client folder and paste them in your client folder.

Now, create a server folder urself in the project folder and name it as "server". Go into the folder and run "npm init -y"
Now a package.json file must have been created. 
In the terminal again write, "npm install express mongoose cors nodemon" and run this.
For this project I used Mongo DB and Mongo Compass.
