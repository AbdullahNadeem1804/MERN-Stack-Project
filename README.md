We have two things, one is client and one is server. 

I used VS Code.

Firstly go to your project fresh folder and open terminal in the folder. 

Run "npm init vite" and create the client folder. Then go into the client folder and run "npm install"

Then run "npm install axios react-router-dom

And now run "npm run dev"

The client is now up and running, you can now paste the files i have provided in the client folder and paste them in your client folder.

Now, create a server folder urself in the project folder and name it as "server". Go into the folder and run "npm init -y"

Now a package.json file must have been created. 

In the terminal again write, "npm install express mongoose cors nodemon" and run this.

For this project I used Mongo DB and Mongo Compass.

In the package.json file go under the "scripts:"{} and add this "start": "nodemon index.js"

Now in the terminal just run, "npm start" and Your server will start.

Now paste the server files I have provided in the folder.

As both the client and server are running then u will see live changes. 

Simple in the client running see where the client is being displayed at and go to that localhost on your web browser. 

Also you will have to edit the code too where i have provided my paths.

The webpage working you will understand.

The mailbox API key you will have to use your own.

And the phishing links one database I have provided in the csv file.

HAPPY PRACTICE :)
